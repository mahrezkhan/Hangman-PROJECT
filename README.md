Hangman is a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. The player has a limited number of guesses (either 3 or 5 attempts). If they cannot guess the word correctly within that limit, the executioner will shoot the player, resulting in a loss. The objective is to guess the word before the executioner's shot.

This game is mainly built using if-else logic in C, which drives the core functionality of the game. The game logic checks whether the player's guess is correct or incorrect, and based on these conditions, the man’s reaction and the executioner's actions change. The game utilizes the IGraphics library to create custom graphics and animations. Each incorrect guess triggers a change in the man’s expression and the executioner's preparation to shoot, making the experience more intense and visually engaging.
